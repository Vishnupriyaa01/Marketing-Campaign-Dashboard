INTRODUCTION

This project focuses on analysing digital marketing campaign performance across Facebook and Instagram using user interaction and ad engagement data. The dataset contains information about campaigns, ads, users, and ad events such as impressions, clicks, and purchases. The objective of this dashboard is to understand how campaigns perform across platforms, audiences, time, and geography, and to identify patterns that can help improve targeting, engagement, and return on marketing spend.

OBJECTIVE

1. KPI Summary Cards
The KPI cards give a quick overview of the entire marketing dataset. They show the scale of campaigns through total ads, total campaigns, total impressions, clicks, users, budget, and events.These metrics help decision-makers instantly understand campaign volume and performance without going into detailed visuals. They act as high-level indicators that summarize overallmarketing effectiveness.

2. Top 5 Campaigns by Impressions
This chart identifies the campaigns that achieved the highest reach, each generating around 13K–14K impressions. It shows that only a few campaigns are driving most of the visibility. These campaigns likely had better targeting, attractive creatives, or were placed on stronger-performing platforms. Marketers can study these top performers to replicate their strategy in futurecampaigns.

3. Ad Platform-wise Comparison by Ad Type
This chart compares how Carousel, Image, Stories, and Video ads perform on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook shows stronger performance in Image and Carousel formats because users engage more with detailed scrolling content. Instagram performs best with Stories due to its visual and fast mobile usage. The graph clearly highlights that ad design should be customized for each
platform to maximize effectiveness.

4. Total Engagement by Campaign & Month
This line chart tracks engagement trends across months from May to August. Engagement remains stable during May, June, and July but drops sharply in August. This suggests ad fatigue or
reduced audience interest over time. It emphasizes the importance of refreshing creatives and monitoring campaign performance regularly.

5. Budget vs Users by Campaign
The scatter plot shows how campaign budgets relate to user reach. The irregular pattern proves that higher spending does not always guarantee more users. Some campaigns use budgets
efficiently, while others waste money with low reach. This chart highlights the need for smarter budget optimization.

6. Purchases by Gender
This donut chart shows that male users contribute 55% of total purchases, followed by females (35%) and others (10%). This indicates that campaigns resonate more strongly with the male
audience. The insight helps marketers tailor messaging and targeting toward high-converting demographics. It also suggests exploring ways to improve female engagement.

7. Purchases by Country
This chart compares purchase contributions across countries. The United States leads significantly, followed by the UK, Canada, and India. It shows stronger campaign performance in developed
markets. Businesses can focus more investment in high-performing regions while improving localization in weaker areas.

8. Users by Gender
This pie chart shows that most users interacting with ads are male (55.32%). Female users account for 34.46% and others 10.22%. This explains the higher purchase share among males. It
confirms that audience engagement aligns closely with conversion behavior.

9. Events by Interests
This chart displays which interest categories are most active among users. Fitness and Health generate the highest events, showing stronger responsiveness. Other categories like Fashion,
Travel, and Technology follow closely. These insights help refine audience targeting strategies.

10. Events by Day of Week
This area chart shows user engagement patterns across weekdays. Friday and Monday record the highest number of ad interactions. Weekends have lower engagement, likely due to reduced online
activity. Advertisers can schedule campaigns during peak days for better results.

11. Impressions by Platform
This donut chart compares total ad visibility across Facebook and Instagram. Facebook dominates with 63.56% of impressions. Instagram contributes 36.44%, indicating it plays a secondary but
important role. This helps marketers decide where to focus reach-based campaigns.

12. Engagement by Time of Day
This line chart shows that engagement peaks during Afternoon and Evening. Morning has moderate interaction, while Night shows the lowest. It reflects user availability and browsing behavior.
Advertisers can use this insight to schedule ads at high-performing hours.
